# JavaScript interview task

Hello,

Congratulations! Your application for JavaScript position has got our attention. Now, it’s time for coding. We want to see your style.

We want you to build simple **web application that displays movies in grid view**.

The task is to implement following requirements:

[ ] Filter duplicated movies from the response  
[ ] Sort movies by imdb rating  
[x] Render all filtered & sorted movies in grid view  
[x] Each rendered movie item should display title, poster, release date and inFavorites status  
[x] Enable keyboard navigation  
[x] Highlight selected item  
[ ] On Enter key add item to favorites / or remove when it is already in favorites

Following hints can be useful:

• You can use movies.json for response  
• To get poster use **base_url**, a **file_size** and a poster_path (example
*https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/uXDfjJbdP4ijW5hWSBrPrlKpxab.jpg*)  
• You should also set you screen size to 1280x720 via Chrome dev tools to see the proper UI

You must use JavaScript (Vanilla JS, Vue.js, React or any other framework you prefer). The outcome should be runnable locally and it should work in common browsers.

We understand that your time is precious and would not want you to spend more than *5 hours* working on the task over the span of one week. It is all right that assignment is not
completed. Try to prioritize what is more important to you.

Here are some tips for you what to take care about:
• Performance  
• Code readability  
• Design - we are not looking for pixel-perfect design, but we love attention to details  
• Commit often, write useful commit messages

After you send us the task, we will carefully review it in a timely manner and might then invite you to an interview, where we can discuss your solution and explore what could be done
differently.
